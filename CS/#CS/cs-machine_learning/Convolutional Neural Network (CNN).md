#### What does it mean by `Convolution`, `Translation-invariant` and `linear transformation`?
- **Convolution**: 
	- Convolution is a mathematical operation where a small matrix (called a filter or kernel) slides over a larger matrix (the input image) to produce a feature map. 
	- This operation helps detect features like edges, textures, and patterns in the image.
	  
- **Translation-invariant**: 
	- This means that the system's response to a given input does not change if the input is shifted in space. 
	- In CNNs, this property allows the network to recognize objects in an image regardless of their position.
	  
- **Linear transformation**: 
	- This is a mathematical operation that maps input values to output values using a linear function. 
	- In neural networks, it often refers to operations like matrix multiplication, where each input is transformed linearly to produce an output.

### What is `Pooling`, `Down Sampling`, `Non-linearity` and `Point-wise ReLU`?

- **Pooling**: 
	- Pooling is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of feature maps</mark>.**<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">(Why do we need to reduces the dimensionality of feature maps?)</mark>**
	- Common types include max pooling and average pooling. Max pooling takes the maximum value from a subset of the feature map, while average pooling takes the average.
	  
- **Down Sampling**: This is the process of reducing the resolution of the feature map, which helps in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reducing computational complexity</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preventing overfitting</mark>.
  
- **Point-wise ReLU**: 
	- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an activation function defined as $ùëì(ùë•)=max‚Å°(0,ùë•)$
	- Point-wise means it is applied to each element individually in the feature map.

- **Non-linearity**: 
	- This refers to applying a non-linear activation function to the output of a linear transformation. 
	- Non-linear functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

#### What is `kernel` in the context of CNN?

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A <span style="font-weight:bold">kernel</span> (or filter) in CNN is a small matrix used to perform the convolution operation. </mark>
- It slides over the input image and multiplies its values with the overlapping values in the image, summing them up to produce a single value in the feature map.

#### What is the difference between CNN and ANN?

**CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**:

- Uses convolutional layers to automatically detect <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">spatial</mark> hierarchies of features.
- Excellent for processing structured grid data like images.
- Includes pooling layers to down-sample data and reduce complexity.

**ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**:

- Consists of fully connected layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layer.
- Generally used for unstructured data.
- Less efficient in handling spatial data like images compared to CNNs.

#### What is `flatten layer` in CNN?

A **flatten layer** in CNN takes the multi-dimensional output of the convolutional and pooling layers and converts it into a one-dimensional vector. This vector is then fed into fully connected (dense) layers for further processing or classification.

### What does `invariant` mean?

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"><strong>Invariant</strong> means that a certain property or feature remains unchanged under specific transformations or conditions.</mark> In CNNs, translation invariance implies that the network can recognize objects regardless of their position in the input image.


#### What is the basic mechanism of CNN?

The basic mechanism of a CNN involves:

1. **Convolutional layers**: Applying filters to detect features.
2. **Activation layers**: Introducing non-linearity with functions like ReLU.
3. **Pooling layers**: Reducing dimensionality while retaining important features.
4. **Fully connected layers**: Using the extracted features to make predictions.

#### Why is CNN good at pattern recognition, including text recognition and face recognition?

CNNs are good at pattern recognition because:
- They automatically learn hierarchical features from data.
- Convolutional layers capture spatial relationships in images.
- Pooling layers reduce complexity and focus on important features.
- Their architecture is designed to handle the high dimensionality and variability of image data efficiently.
