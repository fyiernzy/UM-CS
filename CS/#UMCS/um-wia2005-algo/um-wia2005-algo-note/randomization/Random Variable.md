- ***A random variable is a variable that takes on different values based on the outcome of a random event.*** 
- It can be **discrete** (taking on a finite or countable number of values) or **continuous** (taking on an infinite number of values within a range).

**Example:**
Consider the same coin flip. Let $X$ be a random variable that represents the number of heads in three coin flips. $X$ can take values 0, 1, 2, or 3.
