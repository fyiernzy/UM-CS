- Probabilistic analysis is a technique used to evaluate the performance of an algorithm by <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">considering the likelihood of various inputs and their corresponding outcomes.</mark> 
- Instead of analyzing the worst-case scenario, probabilistic analysis focuses on the expected behavior of an algorithm over all possible inputs, weighted by their probabilities.

**Example:**
Consider the `QuickSort` algorithm. While its worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, probabilistic analysis shows that, on average, it runs in $O(n \log n)$ time. This average-case complexity is determined by considering all possible input permutations and their probabilities.
