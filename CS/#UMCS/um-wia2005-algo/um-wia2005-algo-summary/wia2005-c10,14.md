# Introduction
---
1. A graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$ is a data structure consisting of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$ that connect pairs of vertices.
2. $|V|$ indicates the number of vertices while $|E|$ indicates the number of edges.
3. **Neighbors** are vertices adjacent to one another and joined by edges.
4. An **acyclic graph** is a graph with cycles.
5. A **free tree** is a connected, undirected graph with no simple cycles. It is connected with $|V|-1$ edges.
6. An **undirected** graph is connected if there is at least one path from any vertex to any other
8. **Topological sorting** is an algorithm used to order the vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for any directed edge $(v, u)$, vertex $v$ comes before vertex $u$ in the ordering. *It is significant in resolving dependencies between vertices and ensuring that their order is aligned correctly.*

# Minimum Spanning Tree
---
 A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph is a subset of the graph that includes all the vertices ($V$) and exactly $V-1$ edges, such that the subset forms a tree (i.e., it is connected and acyclic) and the total weight of the edges in the subset is minimized.

**Kruskal's algorithm**
1. The algorithm first initializes each vertex into its own set using the `MAKE-SET` operation.
2. Next, it sorts all edges by their weight, from lowest to highest. 
3. The algorithm then iterates through each edge and checks if the vertices $u$ and $v$ of the edge belong to the same set using the `FIND-SET` operation. 
4. If $u$ and $v$ are in different sets, it connects them by calling `UNION`. 
5. If they are in the same set, it indicates that $u$ and $v$ are already connected, so no action is taken. 
6. The process is repeated for each edge. 
7. Iterating all edges takes $O(E)$, while sorting edges takes $O(E\ \text{log}\ E)$.

**Prim's algorithm**
1. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex.
2. It finds the edge with the lowest weight that connects the starting vertex to another vertex, marking the destination vertex as `VISITED`.
3. The algorithm then inserts all edges of this vertex into a min-priority queue. 
4. In each subsequent iteration, the algorithm extracts the edge with the lowest weight, adds the destination vertex of this edge to the tree (if it is not already visited), and inserts all edges of the newly added vertex into the priority queue.
5. This process is repeated until all vertices are included in the tree.

# Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
---
Single Source Shortest Path finds the shortest paths from a selected source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.

**Dijkstra's algorithm**
1. The algorithm initializes the cost to reach all every vertex to infinity, except for the source vertex, which is set to 0. 
2. Starting from the source, the algorithm relaxes each of its neighboring vertices by updating their costs if a shorter path is found.
3. The relaxation checks if the current known cost to a vertex $v$ ($v.cost$) is greater than the cost to reach an adjacent vertex $u$ plus the edge weight $w(u,v)$. If $v.cost > u.cost + w(u,v)$, then $v.cost$ is updated to $u.cost + w(u,v)$.

4. This process is repeated for all vertices.

**Bellman-Ford algorithm**
1. The algorithm initializes the cost to reach every vertex to infinity except for the source vertex, which is set to 0. 
2. For each vertex, the algorithm relaxes its neighboring vertices by updating their costs if a shorter path is found.
3. The process is repeated for *(every vertex in each iteration)* $|V|-1$ iterations, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph.
4. The algorithm stops early if no relaxation occurs during an iteration, indicating that the shortest paths have been found.
5. Additionally, after $|V|-1$ iterations, the algorithm perform s one more iteration to check for negative-weight cycles. If any cost can still be reduced, it indicates that presence of a negative-weight cycle.

- In the worst case scenario, a graph $G$ with $|V|$ vertices requires $|V|-1$ edges to relax all edges and connect pairs of vertices. 
- Bellman-Ford algorithm determines if there's a negative weight cycle by checking any vertex can still be updated after $|V|-1$ iterations, using the condition $v.d > u.d + w(u,v)$. 

# All Pairs Shortest Path Algorithm
---
All pairs shortest path algorithm finds the shortest path between any pair of vertices in the graph. It states that:

> For every pair of vertices $(u,v)\in G.V$, a shortest (least-weight) path from $u$ to $v$ is determined, where the weight of a path is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

The **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** solves this question using dynamic programming.

1. **Initialization**
	1. The algorithm initializes a $V \times V$ matrix $dist$, where $dist[u][v]$ represents the shortest distance from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$.
	2. Initially, $dit[u][v]$ is set to the weight of edge $(u,v)$ if it exists, or infinity if it does not, except for the diagonal elements which are set to zero (i.e., $dist[u][u]=0$)
2. **Dynamic Programming**:
	1. The algorithm iterates through each vertex $k$ as an intermediate vertex and updates the distance between all pairs of vertices $u$ and $v$.
	2. For each pair $(u,v)$, it checks if the path from $u$ to $v$ through $k$ is shorter than the current known path. This is done using the relaxation step: $$dist[u][v]=\text{min}\left(dist[u][v], dist[u][k]+dist[k][v]\right)$$
	3. This process is repeated for each vertex $k$, ensuring that the shortest paths are found considering considering $k$ as the intermediate vertex for every pair of vertices $(u,v)$
