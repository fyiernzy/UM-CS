**Goals of requirement management**
- *Manages the changes in requirement*
- *Keeps track the relationship between requirements*
- *Ensures implementations align with the requirements*
- To avoid errors by tracking in changes in requirements
- To prioritize requirements based on specific criteria.
- To ensure complete implementation of the requirements.
- To prepare requirement views tailored for different stakeholders

**Differentiate between pre-traceability and post-traceability for system requirement.**
- Pre-traceability tracks requirements back to ~~its~~ *their* origins, ensuring ~~requirements~~  they align with the project objectives and stakeholder needs. It focuses on "why" ~~a requirement should be implemented.~~ the requirement exists, ensuring alignment with initial goals.
- Post-traceability tracks ~~the~~ requirements ~~towards~~ forward to ~~its~~ their implementation and evaluation, ensuring implementations align with requirements/ solution meets the specified requirements. It focuses on "how" a requirement should be implemented.

 **Discuss factors that can cause change to requirement for a software project.**
 - Changes in organizational structure or operational processes
 - Errors, *conflicts* or inconsistencies in the initial requirement
 - Evolving stakeholders knowledge of the system as they gain deeper understanding about the project
 - Changes in priorities due to new competitors ~~or new trends.~~ changes in staff, or a revised business vision.
 - Constraints in budget, project timeline and ~~resources~~ technology.
 - Discovery of new requirements at the later stage of software development process
 
 **Important steps of requirement prioritization process for software requirement.**
1. Determine the purpose of prioritization *and group the requirements accordingly*
2. Based on the purpose, select at least one criteria for prioritization. Criteria can include cost, ~~project~~ implementation duration, risk, stability, business value, damage due to unsuccessful implementation.
3. Invite relevant stakeholders with different perspectives and knowledge, such as developers, customers, testers and software engineers.
4. Choose an appropriate prioritization to perform such as one-criterion, Kano classification, top-ten and requirement ranking.
