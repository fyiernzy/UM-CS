| Job | CPU Cycle | Arrival Time | Finish Time | Turnaround Time |
| --- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1   | 10        | 0            | 21          | 21 - 0 = 21     |
| 2   | 2         | 1            | 3           | 3 - 1 = 2       |
| 3   | 3         | 2            | 7           | 7 - 2 = 5       |
| 4   | 1         | 3            | 4           | 4 - 3 = 1       |
| 5   | 5         | 4            | 12          | 12 - 4 = 8      |

$$\text{Average Turnaround Time}=\left(\frac{21+2+5+1+8}{5}\right)=7.4$$

## 2.b) Round Robin

| Job | CPU Cycle | Arrival Time | Finish Time | Turnaround Time |
| --- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1   | 10        | 0            | 21          | 21 - 0 = 21     |
| 2   | 2         | 1            | 4           | 4 - 1 = 3       |
| 3   | 3         | 2            | 12          | 12 - 2 = 10     |
| 4   | 1         | 3            | 7           | 7 - 3 = 4       |
| 5   | 5         | 4            | 17          | 17 - 4 = 13     |

$$\text{Average Turnaround Time}=\left(\frac{21+3+10+4+13}{5}\right)=10.2$$

## 2.c)
- Refer to the workings in 2.a) and 2.b).
- Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) has shorter average turn-around time.

# Question 3
- A **deadlock** is a situation where multiple processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting indefinitely for resources held by the others.
- Conditions for a deadlock to occur
	- Mutually exclusion. 
		- Only one process can use a resource at any time. ***OR***
		- No process can use a resource if it is already held by the others.
	- Resource holding/ *Hold and Wait*
		- Processes *hold* resources while *waiting* for resources held by others.
	- No preemption
		- Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process before its completion; they must be released voluntarily. ***OR***
		- No temporary reallocation of resources is allowed.
	- Circular Wait. 
		- A closed chain of processes exists where each process holds at least one resource needed by the next process in the chain *(and waits for the others to release their resources.)*

> **Circular wait** is a broader view of **resource holding**, where every process in the chain is engaged in *holding* resources while *waiting* for other processes to release theirs.
