# Question 1
*(Lecture Note 2 - Early Memory Management)*
1. **Single-user continuous scheme** does not support multiprogramming, limiting to one program execution at a time.
2. **Fixed Partition** causes internal fragmentation, wasting memory within partitions.
3. **Dynamic Partition** causes external fragmentation, wasting memory between partitions.
4. **Relocatable Dynamic Partition** introduces computational overhead to perform compaction, including keep tracking of the each job's status and relocating the jobs.

# Question 2
1. **Large time quantum** turns the algorithm into First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), reducing preemption benefits and leading to inefficient CPU utilization.
2. **Small time quantum** increases context switching, slowing down jobs and raising overhead significantly.  Context switching involves saving and loading process state, requiring additional computational resources and memory for Process Control Blocks (PCBs).

# Question 7
1. Read, Execute, Delete
2. Read, Write, Execute
3. Read, Write, Delete
4. Execute

# Question 8
1. **Starvation** is a situation where a process waits indefinitely for resources that never become available, preventing it from executing.
2. A **deadlock** is a situation where multiple processes unable to proceed because each is waiting indefinitely for resources held by the others.
3. A **thread** is the smallest execution unit of a process that can run independently and concurrently with other threads.
4. **Mutual exclusion** is a property that ensures only one process can use a resource at a time. 
   *Once a process holds a resource, no other process can access the same resource until it is released by the current process.*
