# Question 1
*(Lecture Note 2 - Early Memory Management)*
1. **Single-user Contiguous Scheme** does not support multiprogramming, limiting to one program execution at a time.
2. **Fixed Partition** causes internal fragmentation, leading to wasted memory within partitions.
3. **Dynamic Partition** causes external fragmentation, leading to wasted memory between partitions.
4. **Relocatable Dynamic Partition** introduces computational overhead to perform compaction.

> **Single-user Contiguous Scheme** does not support multiprogramming or networking as it executes only one program at a time. It wastes memory spaces if the job is smaller than the available memory space.
> 
> **Fixed Partition** requires entire program to be stored contiguously. It rejects jobs if they cannot fit into the largest partition. It causes internal fragmentations, wasting memory within partitions if jobs are smaller than partitions.

# Question 2
*(Lecture Note 2 - Early Memory Management, pg. 62)*
**Bound Register**
- It stores the upper limit of memory addresses a program can access.
- It ensures that the program does not access memory outside its allocated spaces during execution, thus providing memory protection.

**Relocation Register**
- Stores the base address of the program's allocated memory.
- Helps the MMU (Memory Management Unit) to translate logical addresses to physical addresses by adding the base address.
- Ensures the system accesses the correct memory addresses after relocation.

# Question 6
*(Lecture 7 - Device Management)*
**Buffering**
- Buffering uses a temporary storage to hold data while it is being transferred between two locations, such as between a disk and main memory. 
- ***It allows the system to handle data at different speeds and improves overall performance by reducing the time spent waiting for I/O operations.***

**Blocking**
- Blocking involves ***grouping of multiple logical records*** into a single physical block. This reduces I/O operations by allowing a single READ or WRITE command to transfer a larger amount of data at once.
- It also optimizes the storage media usage, such as tape, by minimizing the space wasted by inter-record gaps. 

> *Combined size of records in a block is larger then the cumulative size of individual inter-record gaps. Therefore, the tape contains more records than inter-record gaps.*

- Seek time is the time taken to position the read/write head of a disk over the correct track where desired data is located.
- Search time (Rotational latency) is the time taken for the disk to rotate and align the the requested record (data) under the read/write head. 

# Question 7
*(Lecture 8 - Device Management)*
1. Read, Execute, Delete
2. Read, Write, Execute
3. Read, Write, Delete
4. Execute

- READ allows the user to read the file
- EXECUTE allows the user to execute the file 
- DELETE allows the user to delete the file

# Question 8
- A **process** is an active program that requires resources such as CPU *(processor)* and memory *(registers)* to execute.
- A **deadlock** is a situation where multiple processes unable to proceed because each is wait indefinitely for resources held by the others.
- A **thread** is smallest unit of execution *(executable part)* within a  process that can run independently and concurrently with other threads. 
- *(Lecture 6 - Concurrent Processes)* A **semaphores** is a synchronization mechanism that uses an integer value to manage access to shared resources and ensure mutual exclusion. It is used to signal the availability of a resource.
