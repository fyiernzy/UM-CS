# 1 - Survey techniques
---
- **Questionnaires**
	- **Definition**
		- Printed documents or online forms with multiple-choice questions or Likert scale items.
	- **Advantages**
		1. Gather a lot of information at a low cost.
		2. Can be widely distributed, covering diverse regions and reaching a large audience.
		3. Ideal for discovering basic factors.
		4. Can be easily anonymized, encouraging honest responses.
		5. Users can respond at their convenience
		6. Inspires stakeholders to give ideas.
		7. Reduce interviewer bias, leading to more objective results.
	- **Disadvantages**
		1. Limited to only known questions.
		2. Efficiency depends heavily on question structure.
		3. Impossible to conduct further inquiry on questions.
		4. May have low response rates.
		5. Cannot capture non-verbal cues or emotions.

-  **Interview**
	- **Advantages**
		1. Ideal for discovering satisfiers
		2. Can obtain detailed information (*on current system issues and requirements*)
		3. Can clarify and probe deeper into responses, ensuring in-depth understanding of system requirements and goals.
	- **Disadvantages**
		1. Time consuming.
		2. Efficiency depends heavily on how the interviewer asks questions.
		3. Can be costly if many stakeholders need to be interviewed.
		4. Responses can be biased by the interviewer's influence.


# 2 - Document-centric techniques
---
> **Common Strength**
>     1. Independent of stakeholders (but still requires their validations).
>     2. Discover existing requirements (FR, QR, C) in detail.
>    
>**Common Weaknesses**
>     1. May involve irrelevant work since not everything is related to current project.
>     2. Unfamiliarity with the system can pose challenges

- **System Archaeology**: Extracts information from existing documentation or implementation (codes) of a system.

- **Requirement Reuse**
	- Reuse requirements from other projects, reducing time, cost and effort.
	- Existing requirements should be 
		- Retrievable by requirements engineers.
		- Detailed enough for requirements engineers to decide their suitability for reuse.

- **Perspective-based learning**
	- Read documents with a specific perspective
	- Allows the RE to focus on and filter information from a particular perspective while reading and analyzing a document.

# 3 - Observation techniques
---
> - Both are ideal for discovering basic factors/ dissatisfiers

- **Field observation
	- Observing users in their natural environment helps identify implicit needs and expectations that users might not articulate otherwise.
	- **Strengths**: 
		- Elicits requirements from busy stakeholders or those who struggle to describe their operations
	- **Weaknesses**:
		- Limited to existing requirements.
		- Not suitable for new processes.

- **Apprenticeship**: 
	- Work under stakeholder guidance to understand their tasks and processes.
	- **Strengths**: 
		- Allows querying stakeholders about existing solutions.
		- Challenges the existing solution to suggest improvements.
	- **Weaknesses**
		- Time-consuming for stakeholders
		- Requires domain knowledge from the requirement engineer.

# 4 - Creativity Techniques
---
> Similarities
>     - Ideal for discovering delighters/ excitement factors
>     - Risk of dominance by loud participants. Dominant participants may overshadow quieter ones.
>     - Time consuming
>     - Cannot get detailed information. Needs to be combined with interviews for detailed requirements.

- **Classical Brainstorming**
	- Involves discussions where stakeholders generate ideas spontaneously to solve problems.
	- Strengths
		- **Popcorn reactions**: Participants inspire each other with their ideas.
		- Encourages creative thinking and innovative solutions.
	- **Disadvantages**
		- Efficiency depends on the moderator's ability to manage the session and control criticism.
		- May produce many ideas, making it hard to prioritize.

- **Brainstorming Paradox**
	- Focus on what is undesirable to find preventative measures.

- **Change of Perspective (Six Thinking Hats)**
	- Participants view the problem from different perspectives
		- Blue Hat (Process) - Focuses on managing the process.
		- White Hat (Facts) - Provides information and data.
		- Red Hat (Feelings) - Reflects intuition, hunches, and gut instincts.
		- Green Hat (Creativity) - Generates ideas, alternatives, and solutions to problems.
		- Yellow Hat (Benefits) - Highlights positives and logical reasons.
		- Black Hat (Cautions) - Identifies difficulties, weaknesses, and risks with logical reasoning.

- **Analogy**
	- Stakeholders analyze analogies from other domains.
	- There are two types:
		- **Open analogy**: Analyze the analogy while informing stakeholders about the software problem.
		- **Close analogy**: Hide information about the software until stakeholders recognize the analogy.
	- **Strengths**:
		- Provides new inspiration and perspectives.
	- **Weaknesses**:
		- Difficult if participants lack deep knowledge.
		- Hard to find a fitting analogy.
