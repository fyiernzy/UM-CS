# Question 2
---
## Q2.a)
1. Dissatisfiers/ Must-Have/ Expected Quality
2. Satisfiers/ Performance/ Desired Quality
4. Delighters/ Excitement/ Excited Quality

## Q2.b)
1. **Satisfiers/ Performance/ Desired Quality**
	1. Interview
		1. Interviews allow for detailed questions and  clarifications, ensuring an in-depth understanding of desired system functionalities and capturing performance requirements accurately.
	2. Other possible methods: System archaeology

2. **Dissatisfiers/ Must-Have/ Expected Quality**
	1. **Questionnaires** can collect feedback from a large, distributed audience about the essential functionalities of the system. It can reach a broad audience quickly and gather a wide range of responses.
	3. Other possible methods: 
		1. **Field Observation**: Observing users in their natural environment helps identify implicit needs and expectations that users might not articulate in other settings.
		2. **Apprenticeship**: Working alongside users helps in understanding the tasks and processes they follow, ensuring that the system meets their fundamental needs.
		3. **System archaeology**: Analyzing existing systems can provide insights into essential requirements that need to be retained or improved in the new system.
3. **Delighters/ Excitement/ Excited Quality**
	1. Brainstorming sessions encourage creative thinking and the generation of innovative ideas by allowing participants to build on each other's suggestions (*popcorn reactions*). It fosters an open an collaborative environment.
	3. Other possible methods: Brainstorming paradox, Analogy, 6 thinking hats

## Q2.c)
**Questionnaires.**
- Gather a lot of information at a low cost.
- Can be distributed widely, covering diverse regions and reaching distributed audience.
- Users can respond at their convenience
- Reduce interviewer bias, leading to more objective results.

## Q3.b)
- **Functional requirements** 
	- **Formal Definition**
		- *(Pohl & Rupp, 2011)* A functional requirement is a requirement concerning a result of behavior that shall be provided by a function of the system.
	- **Simplified definitions**
		- Functions or behaviors that the system must provide.
		- Describe how the system should behave. 
		- Describes the system in terms of layout designs, functionalities, and sequences in different conditions. 
- **Quality requirements** 
	- **Definition**
		- *(Pohl & Rupp, 2011)*  A quality requirement is a requirement that pertains to a quality concern that is not covered by functional requirements.
	- **Simplified definitions**
		- Quality concerns not covered by functional requirements.
		- Describe how the system should perform. 
		- Specify the criteria or regulations that the system should comply with.

# Question 4
---
## Q4.a)
1. Discovery of new requirements during implementation of testing stages.
2. Changes in the organization's structure or operational processes.
3. Evolving stakeholder knowledge of the system as they gain a deeper understanding of the system.
4. Changes in customer priorities due to new competitors, changes in staff, or a revised business vision.
10. Constraints and issues related to technology, project timelines, or budget.
12. Errors, conflicts, or inconsistencies in the initial requirements

## Q4.b)
Importance of attribute identifiers
- Uniquely identify each requirement
- Facilitate traceability between requirements
- Indicate version control
- Improve communication among stakeholders by referring to a specific requirement using clear identifiers.

Three typical attributes of software requirements
- Identifiers
- Requirement Description (The system shall/must/will/should ...)
- Source
- Status
- Cost
- Priority (Sequence of realization)
- Benefit of the requirement
- Effort to implement
- Kano model type (Dissatisfier, Satisfier, Delighter)
- Requirement type (Functional, Quality)
- SRS Version
- Requirement Stability (Low, Medium, High)

## Q4.c)
- Determine the purpose of prioritization and group the requirements accordingly.
- Choose criteria for prioritization based on the purpose. Criteria can include cost, implementation duration, risk (possibility of implementation failure), stability (probability of changes), business value and importance/ damage due to unsuccessful implementation.
- Invite relevant stakeholders with specific knowledge or view about the project, such as development teams, project managers, users, testers and quality managers.
- Choose an appropriate prioritization technique to perform, such as one-criterion classification, Kano classification, ranking and top-ten.

## Q4.d)
- Kano classification categorizes requirements into three types:
	- **Dissatisfiers**: Basic requirements that must be met for the software to be acceptable in the market. They are given the highest priority.
	- **Satisfiers**: Performance requirements that fulfill customer needs and should be prioritized next.
	- **Delighters**. Excitement factors that exceed customer expectations but are not necessary. These are prioritized last as they act as bonus features.
- **Suitable situation**:
	- Kano classification is ideal when there are many requirements to be prioritized, providing a rough yet effective way to classify and manage them.
	- It can be used in conjunction with other techniques to enhance the precision of the prioritization process.
