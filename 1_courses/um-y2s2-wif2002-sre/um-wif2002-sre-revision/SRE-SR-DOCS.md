Importance of requirement documentation
1. Serves as a reference for all stakeholders ~~for a~~, *ensuring a* shared understanding
2. Serves as a reference for other phases in software development process, ensuring alignment with requirements during design, development and testing
3. Identify and minimize gaps and inconsistencies in understanding among stakeholders
4. Address legal conflicts between parties, as requirements have legal relevance.
5. ~~Ensure faster understanding for newcomers~~
6. *Ensure understanding of the system for newcomers*
7. *Preserves organizational and project knowledge*
9. *Map requirements to the project objective*
10. *Facilitates communication among stakeholders by ensuring a shared understanding*

 Compares Requirement Document and System Requirement Specification (SRS)
- A **requirement document** is a *systematically represented* collection of requirements, *typically for a system or component, that satisfies given criteria.* specifying what requirement should be implemented.
- A **System Requirement Specification (SRS)** is a *detailed, formal* documentation specify how a requirement should be implemented. and *serves as reference for development activities such as designing and testing. Is also acts as a contract.*


 Compare lexical ambiguity and syntactic ambiguity
 - Lexical ambiguity occurs when a word in the sentence has multiple interpretations. For example, *The system shall calculate the distance from the bank*, the word *bank* can refer to *the river side* or a *financial institute*.
 - Syntactic ambiguity occur when the sentence has multiple interpretations. For example, *The system shall allow manager to enter access card with access code* can be interpretated as
	 - The manager enters the access code first, then the access card.
	 - The manager enters the access card that contains access code.

 ***Important information that need to be documented during requirements engineering process.***
 - ***Change Request***
 - ***Interview Minutes***

 Describe about glossary and its benefits in the software requirements engineering process.
 - A glossary is a collection of *technical* terms *relevant to a specific project or domain*. 
 - It defines specific meaning of each term and may include references to related terms and examples that explain the term.
 - Benefits
	 - *Avoid lexical ambiguity by defining each term, reducing misunderstanding*
	 - Ensure consistent terms are used across the documents
	 - ~~Ensure shared understanding among stakeholders~~ Ensure consistent interpretation of each term.
	 - Facilitate communication among stakeholders

 Define ambiguously documented requirement.
 - Ambiguously documented requirement is a requirement that lacks necessary details and *descriptions*, causing misinterpretations among different stakeholders.

 Causes of Ambiguous Requirements
 - Nominalization. The requirement lacks necessary details *to describe a process* and converts multiple process into a single event. For example, *The system shall assign the tasks automatically to the staffs*  does not describe *how* and *when* it should assign the task.
 - Nouns without Reference Index. The requirement uses incompletely specified nouns, such as *the user* and *the data*. For example, *The system shall display the data* does not clarify what data refers to.
 - Universal quantifiers. The requirement uses universal quantifiers such as *all, each, every* without sufficient information and causes ambiguity. For example, *The system shall display all payment details* can be interpretated as:
	 - The system displays every individual payment records.
	 - The system displays overall payment analysis.
 - Incompletely specified condition. The requirement does not describe normal, alternative of exception flow. For example, *If a student fails an exam, the system shall inform the examination office via email.* does not describe what happens if the student passes the exam.
 - Incompletely specified process verb. The requirement does not provide enough information regarding a process. For example, *The system shall transmit* does not specify *what* to be transmitted, from *where* and to *where*.

Importance of requirement documentation
1. Serves as a reference for all stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding
2. Helps identify gaps and inconsistencies in understanding among stakeholders
3. Maps the requirements to the project objectives
4. Helps overcome legal conflicts between parties as requirements has legal relevance
5. Facilitates communication among stakeholders by ensuring a shared understanding
6. Preserves organizational and project knowledge
7. Serves as a reference for other development activities, ensuring alignment with requirements during designing and testing.
8. Facilitates understanding of the system for newcomers
9. Helps keep track of the what and how the system should behave as it becomes more complex.

 Compares Requirement Document and System Requirement Specification (SRS)
 - A Requirement Document is a systematically represented *collection of* document, typically for a component or a system, that satisfies the criteria. It defines *what* should be implemented in the system.
 - A System Requirement Specification (SRS) is a detailed, formal documents specifying how a requirement should be implemented.
	 - reference contract

 Describe about glossary and its benefits in the software requirements engineering process.
 - A glossary is a collection of technical terms relevant to a project or a domain
 - It contains explanation of each term and includes references related to the term as well as the examples to explain the term. 
	 - meaning , may include, references examples
 - Benefits
	 - Avoid lexical ambiguity by defining each terms, reducing misunderstanding
	 - Promote consistent use of term across all documents
	 - Ensure consistent meaning of each term
	 - Facilitates communication among stakeholder by reducing misunderstanding.

 Define ambiguously documented requirement.
 An ambiguously documented requirement is a requirement that lacks necessary details and description and has multiple interpretations.

 Causes of Ambiguous Requirements (Universal Quantifiers, incompletely specified process verb)
 - Universal Quantifiers. A requirement uses universal quantifiers such as all, every, each without sufficient information and causes ambiguity due to multiple interpretations.
 - Incompletely specified process verb. A requirement lacks necessary details regarding a process.
