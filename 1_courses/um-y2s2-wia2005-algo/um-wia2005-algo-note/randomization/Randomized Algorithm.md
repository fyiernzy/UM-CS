A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that uses random numbers at some point during its process to make decisions. This randomness can help improve the algorithm's performance in practice, simplify the implementation, or ensure that the algorithm behaves well on average, even if it might perform poorly on specific worst-case inputs.


**Example:**
A simple randomized algorithm is the Randomized QuickSort. Instead of always picking the first or last element as the pivot, it randomly selects a pivot element for partitioning the array. This random choice helps avoid the worst-case scenarios typically associated with sorted or nearly sorted input arrays.
