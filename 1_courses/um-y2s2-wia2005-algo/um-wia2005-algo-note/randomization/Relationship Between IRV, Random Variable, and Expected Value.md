- An [[Indicator Random Variable (IRV)]] is a specific type of random variable that only takes values 0 and 1, indicating the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particular event.
- The [[Expected Value of a Random Variable]] of IRV corresponds to the probability of the event it represents. For an IRV $I$,
  $$E(I) = 1 \cdot P(I=1) + 0 \cdot P(I=0) = P(I=1)$$

**Example:**
If $I$ is the indicator random variable for getting heads in a single coin flip, then $E(I) = P(I=1) = \frac{1}{2}$.
