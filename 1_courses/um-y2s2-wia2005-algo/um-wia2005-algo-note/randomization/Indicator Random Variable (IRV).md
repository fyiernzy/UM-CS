- An Indicator Random Variable (IRV) is a special type of [[Random Variable]] that takes the value 1 if a certain event occurs and 0 otherwise. 
- It is often used to simplify the analysis of probabilistic events in algorithms.

**Example:**
Consider a simple example where you flip a fair coin. Define an indicator random variable $I$ such that $I = 1$ if the coin lands on heads, and $I = 0$ if it lands on tails.
