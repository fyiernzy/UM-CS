### Advantages
[[Algorithm/Randomized/Heapsort]] combines the strength of both [[Merge Sort]] and [[Insertion Sort]]. 

- Similar to [[Merge Sort]], it guarantees worst-case time complexity of $O(n log n)$ which is much faster than [[Insertion Sort]]; 
- Similar to [[Insertion Sort]], it is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only a constant amount of storage spaces for sorting.

### Disadvantages
- [[Algorithm/Randomized/Heapsort]] is a [[Non-Stable Sorting Algorithm]], meaning it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.
- Due to its non-sequential memory access pattern, [[Algorithm/Randomized/Heapsort]] often exhibits poor cache performance. This can make it slower in practice compared to other sorting algorithms like quicksort and merge sort, which have better locality of reference. 
- The implementation of [[Algorithm/Randomized/Heapsort]] is more complex.
- [[Algorithm/Randomized/Heapsort]] does not take advantage of existing order in the data.
