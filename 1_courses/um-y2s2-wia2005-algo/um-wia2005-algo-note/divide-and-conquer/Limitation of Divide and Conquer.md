2. **Overhead Costs**:
	- **Recursive Overhead**: Divide and conquer algorithms often rely heavily on recursion, which can add overhead due to function call management.
	-  **Stack Overflow**: Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth exceeds the maximum stack size.
	  
2. **Base Case and Conquer Step**:
    - **Inefficient Base Case Handling**: If the base case is not handled efficiently, it can negate the benefits of dividing the problem.
    - **Cost of Merging/Combining**: The conquer step, which involves merging or combining results from subproblems, can be costly. For example, in merge sort, the merging step takes ùëÇ(ùëõ) time.
      
3. **Balancing Subproblems**: Some problems may not divide evenly, leading to unbalanced subproblems that can degrade performance. This imbalance can cause the algorithm to approach its worst-case time complexity.
      
4. **Memory Usage**:
    - **High Memory Consumption**: Divide and conquer algorithms may require additional memory to store intermediate results or manage recursive calls, leading to increased memory usage.
    - **Cache Performance**: Recursive algorithms may exhibit poor cache performance due to frequent context switches and non-sequential memory access patterns.
      
5. **Algorithm Complexity**:
    - **Implementation Complexity**: Implementing divide and conquer algorithms can be complex and error-prone, especially for problems that require sophisticated partitioning and merging strategies.
    - **Debugging Difficulty**: Recursive algorithms can be harder to debug and trace compared to their iterative counterparts.
