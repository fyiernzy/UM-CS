 - A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph is a subset of the graph that includes all the vertices ($V$) and exactly $V-1$ edges, such that the subset forms a tree (i.e., it is connected and acyclic) and the total weight of the edges in the subset is minimized.
  
- *(S, 2023)* A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects are the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
  
- *(SciPy v1.13.1 Manual)* A minimum spanning tree is a graph consisting of the subset of edges which together connect all connected nodes, while minimizing the total sum of weights on the edges.
