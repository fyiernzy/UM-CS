# Question 1
1. $O(n)$
2. $O(n^2)$
3. $O(n\ \text{log}\ n)$
4. Recurrence relation, $T(n)=2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+O(n)$.
	1. Using Master Theorem, 
		1. $a=2,b=2,\text{log}_{b}\ a=\text{log}_{2}\ 2=1, k=1, p=0$
		2. Since $log_{b}\ a=k$, we consider the case 2 situation
		3. Since $p>-1$, $T(n)=\Theta(n^{k}log^{p+1}\ n)=\Theta(n^{1}\text{log}^{p+1}\ n)=\Theta(n\ \text{log}\ n)$
	4. Using recursive tree, $T(n)=n\ \text{log}_{2}\ n=O(n\ \text{log}\ n)$

5. Recurrence relation, $T(n)=T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+O(1)$
	1. Using Master Theorem,
		1. $a=1, b=2, \text{log}_{b}\ a=\text{log}_{2}\ 1=0,k=0,p=0$
		2. Since $log_{b}\ a=k$, we consider case 2 situation.
		3. Since $p>-1$, $T(n)=\Theta(n^{k}\text{log}^{p+1}\ n)=\Theta(n^{0}\text{log}^{0+1}\ n)=\Theta(\text{log}\ n)$
	2. Using recursive tree, $T(n)=\text{log}_{2}\ n=O(\text{log}\ n)$

# Question 2
*Question 2 is about String Matching, which is not included in the 2023/2024 Semester 2 Final. Therefore, I have skipped this question.*

# Question 3
*Question 3 is about Parallelism, which is not part of  the 2023/2024 Semester 2 syllabus. So, I have skipped this question.*

# Question 6
## 6.a)
```pseudo
FUNCTION ROUND-ROBIN(requests, servers)
	FOR request IN requests DO
		DEQUEUE server FROM servers
		ASSIGN request TO server
		ENQUEUE server TO servers
	END FOR
END FUNCTION
```
- $T(n)=O(n)$, $n$ refers to the number of requests.
- $O(n)$ for iterating through all the requests
- $O(1)$ for `ENQUEUE` and `DEQUE` operations for a FIFO queue.


## 6.b)
```psuedo
FUNCTION ASSIGN-TO-MIN(requests, servers)
	FOR request IN requests DO
		DEQUEUE server FROM servers
		ASSIGN request TO server
		ENQUEUE server TO servers
	END FOR
END FUNCTION
```
- $T(n)=O(n\ log\ m)$ . 
	- $n$ refers to the number of requests.
	- $m$ refers to the number of servers
- Explanation:
	- $O(n)$ for iterating through all the requests
	- $O(log\ m)$ for `ENQUEUE` and `DEQUE` operations for a priority queue.

## 6.c)

```pseudo
FUNCTION ASSIGN-TO-RANDOM(requests, servers)
	FOR request IN requests DO
		index = RANDOM(0, LENGTH(servers) - 1)
		server = servers[index]
		ASSIGN request TO server
	END FOR
END FUNCTION
```
- $T(n)=O(n)$ . 
- Explanation:
	- $O(n)$ for iterating through all the requests
	- $O(1)$ for choosing a server at random.


Indicator Random Variable (IRV) is defined as follow:
$$
\begin{equation}
	  I\{S\}=
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if}\ \text{server S is chosen} \\
    0 & \text{if}\ \text{server S is not chosen} \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

Let $X_S$ be the [[Indicator Random Variable]] (IRV) associated with the event in which the server S is chosen at random.
$$
E\left(X_{s}\right)= E\left[I\{S\}\right] \
                   = 1 \cdot \text{Pr}\{S\} + 0 \cdot \text{Pr}\{\overline{S}\} \\
                   = 1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \\
                   = \frac{1}{n}
                   
$$

Using the linearity of expectation,
$$
X = X_{i},\ 
E(X) = E\left[\sum^{n}_{i=1} X_{i}\right]
     = \sum^{n}_{i=1}E(X_{i})
     = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{1}{n}
     = 1

$$
