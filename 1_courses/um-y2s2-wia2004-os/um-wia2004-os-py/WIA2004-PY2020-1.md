# Question 1
1. **Internal fragmentation** refers to wasted space within allocated memory blocks. It occurs when allocated memory is larger than the actual memory required by the job, leading to unused space within the block.
2. **External fragmentation** refers to the wasted spaces between allocated memory blocks. It occurs 
	1. When free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks due to the allocation and deallocation of memory. ***OR***
	2. Due to the difference in size between jobs in a dynamic partition scheme.

| Job | CPU Cycle | Arrival Time | Finish Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting time |
| --- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 1   | 1         | 0            | 1           | 1 - 0 = 1       | 1 - 1 = 0    |
| 2   | 4         | 1            | 10          | 10 - 1 = 9      | 9 - 4 = 6    |
| 3   | 2         | 2            | 4           | 4 - 2 = 2       | 2 - 2 = 0    |
| 4   | 1         | 3            | 5           | 5 - 3 = 2       | 2 - 1 = 1    |
| 5   | 2         | 4            | 7           | 7 - 4 = 3       | 3 - 2 = 1    |

$$\text{Average Turnaround Time}=\left(\frac{1+9+2+2+3}{5}\right)=3.4$$
$$\text{Average Waiting Time}=\left(\frac{0+6+0+1+1}{5}\right)=1.6$$

*(OS Various Times Related to Process- Javatpoint, n.d.)* 
The **waiting time** is the total amount of time for which the process waits for the CPU to be assigned. ($\text{Waiting Time}=\text{Turnaround Time}-\text{Burst Time}$)

## 3.b) Round Robin

| Job | CPU Cycle | Arrival Time | Finish Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
| --- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 1   | 1         | 0            | 1           | 1 - 0 = 1       | 1 - 1 = 0    |
| 2   | 4         | 1            | 10          | 10 - 1 = 9      | 9 - 4 = 5    |

| 4   | 1         | 3            | 6           | 6 - 3 = 3       | 3 - 1 = 2    |
| 5   | 2         | 4            | 8           | 8 - 4 = 4       | 4 - 2 = 2    |

$$\text{Average Turnaround Time}=\left(\frac{1+9+3+3+4}{5}\right)=4$$
$$\text{Average Waiting Time}=\left(\frac{0+5+1+2+2}{5}\right)=2$$

# Question 4
- A deadlock is a situation where multiple processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting indefinitely for resources held by the others.
- Conditions for a deadlock to occur:
	- **Mutual Exclusion**. Only one process can hold a resource at any time.
	- **Resource Holding/ *Hold and Wait***. Processes hold resources while waiting for resources held by others.
	- **No preemption**. Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process before its completion; they must be released voluntarily.
	- **Circular Wait**. The chain of processes exist where each process hold at least one resource needed in the next process and waits for resources held by the others.
- To resolve the deadlock based on the drawn directed graph, one of the possible ways is *(Method 3)*
	- Terminate processes P2 and P3 (victims)
	- P1 can use resources R2 (released by P2) and R1 to proceed.
	- P4 can use resources R3 (released by P3) and R4 to proceed.
	- After the re-submission, P2 can use resources R1 and R2 (released by P1).
	- After the re-submission, P3 can use resources R2 (released by P2) and R3 and R4 (released by P4).

> *(Lecture Note 5 - Process Management)* **Method 3**: Identify and terminate deadlocked jobs one at a time, checking for deadlock resolution after each termination. 

# Question 5
*Since Chapter 8 - File Management is not included in 2023/2024 Semester 2 Final, I have skipped the question.*
