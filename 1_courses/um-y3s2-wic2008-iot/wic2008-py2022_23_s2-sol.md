## Question 1
---
### 1.a)

1. Layer 1: Physical devices (Sensors & Actuators)
2. Layer 2: Controllers
3. Layer 3: Connectivity
4. Layer 4: Data Accumulation

>[!info] Explanation
>The seven-layer IoT Reference Model introduced by the IoT World Forum consists of the following layers:
>- **Physical Devices and Controllers**:
>	- Consists of endpoint devices and sensors that send and receive information.
>	- Responsible for collecting data and are capable of being queried and/or controlled over a network.
>- **Connectivity**: Ensure reliable and timely data transmission between layer 1 devices and layer 3 information processing.
>- Edge Computing: Perform early data processing for faster information processing and reduce latency.
>- **Data Accumulation**: Stores data for later use
>- **Data Abstraction**: Standardizes multiple data formats and ensures consistent view from various sources
>- **Applicatio**n: Interprets data using software applications. Applications may monitor, control, and provide reports based on the data analysis.
>- Collaboration & Processes: Consumes and shares the application information
>
>However, since the figure given doesn't follow the model completely, we'll need to adjust the answer accordingly.

### 1.b)

Arduino UNO and Raspberry Pi can be implemented at layer 2 since they are controllers and layer 2 contains only controllers.

### 1.c)
- Data in motion refers to data that are being transported or transmitted between locations. It should be located in Layer 1, 2 and 3.
- Data at rest are data that are stored already. It should be located at later 4 where there are data centers responsible for accumulating those data.

Python
```python
from RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from time import *

def main():
	GPIO.setMode(BCM)
	GPIO.pinMode(18, IN)
	GPIO.pinMode(19, OUT)
	
	while True:
		state = GPIO.input(18)
		GPIO.output(19, state)
		sleep(0.2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

### 2.b)
?

### 2.c)

GPIO is General Pin Input/Output.
![[Pasted image 20250707143152.png]]

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from time import *

def main():
	GPIO.setMode(GPIO.BCM)
	GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN)
	
	LEDS = [6, 13, 19, 26]
	for led in LEDS:
		GPIO.setup(led, GPIO.OUT)

	index = 0
	size = len(LEDS)

	while True:
		led = LEDS[index]
		GPIO.output(led, True)
		sleep(1)
		GPIO.output(led, False)

		left_to_right = GPIO.input(18) == True
		if(left_to_right) {
			index = (index + 1) % size
		} else {
			index = (index + size - 1) % size
		}
```



## Question 3

### 3.a)
![[Pasted image 20250707180633.png]]


Raspberry Pi has built-in Wi-Fi capability and is used to establish the connection with Wi-Fi router as well as setup the IoT server remotely, allowing end devices such as exhaust fan(s) and air filter(s) to be managed wirelessly.

Arduino UNO, though lacking Wi-Fi connection capability, it can read analog signals, whereas Raspberry Pi is unable to do that. Hence, it is used to read analog signals from the smoke sensor(s). It also responsible for turning on or off the actuators (i.e. air filter(s) and exhaust fan(s)) based on the predefined thresholds or upon user's actions.


No, because Raspberry Pi provides internet access and setup the IoT server to controls the end devices remotely. Arduino UNO lacks this capability.

### 3.b)

- LoRaWAN: A low-power, wide-area networking (LPWAN) protocol built top of the LoRa radio modulation technique, enabling battery-operated devices to connect to the internet over long distances.
- NB-IoT: A low-power, wide-area networking (LPWAN) protocol that enables small IoT devices to operate efficiently on existing LTE-based networks.
- Wi-Fi: Use Wi-Fi to carry information, requiring Wi-Fi routers.
- ZibBee: A low-power, low-data rate wireless protocol specification used to create personal area networks.
- Bluetooth: Wireless protocol used for data communication over short distances.
- 4G/5G: Cellular-based data networks designed to take advantage of communications over large geographic areas.

### 3.c)

Wi-Fi. Raspberry Pi can be controlled wirelessly using Wi-Fi. Raspberry Pi can also send and receive packets with other wireless devices through Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is chose because it is commonly used in our daily lives for data transmission.

![[Pasted image 20250707164052.png]]

- `GPIO`: It allows SBC board to read the digital input from the garage door.
- `http`: It is used to send data to the IoT server.
- `time`: add delay to the program to prevent overwhelming traffics which can slow down the controller.
