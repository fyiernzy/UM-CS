### Q1 - Triathlon Training Eco-System

*Thomas is training for the next triathlon season. He would like to improve his times in all three events for the next season. Thomas purchases a smart watch to log all of his training sessions. The apps on the smart watch track his training and upload the data to a website. From the website, Thomas can share his workouts with his coach and friends. He also provides information about his activities and the conditions of his running, biking, and swimming equipment through the applications.*

*The apps use the information Thomas provided to alert him when it is time to replace his running shoes. The apps present him with a list of running shoes and related customer reviews. Various local and online retailers bid for Thomas’ business. He chooses the same running shoes that he is using for training. The manufacturer gives him a discount as a repeat customer and ships the shoes to his residence for his convenience. The manufacturer also recommends a few organizations that will recycle old running shoes in his area. As the first triathlon event draws near, his apps provide advice and product recommendations to help Thomas perform his best.*

### Q2 - New in Town - Connected Transportation

*Anya has relocated to a different city for her new job. Her new city is a smart city, and she is exploring how she can navigate the city’s connected transportation. Using the city’s website, Anya discovers that she can download an app that provides real-time information regarding the mass transit system and the roadways. She decides to use the app before her first day at work.*

*When Anya is exploring the city’s website, she finds out about a concert across the bay. She purchases a ticket using the app, and a receipt is sent via email. She plans to ride the ferry and city buses to her destination. The app provides Anya with the bus and ferry schedules that will work best for her. The app also alerts her when she should depart in order to arrive at the show on time.*

*During her ride to the show, Anya uses the Wi-Fi connection to explore the city services and amenities. The app alerts her that there is a traffic incident on her current route and suggests an alternate bus route that will allow her to arrive at the venue faster. At the conclusion of the show, the app recommends future activities based on her feedback about the concert.*
