### **Study: Proposal for a Wireless Attendance & Safety Monitoring System**

**1. Executive Summary & Objective**

This document outlines a proposal to implement a modern, wireless system to track attendance and enhance the safety of personnel on campus. The primary objective is to move beyond manual attendance sheets to an automated, real-time system that improves operational efficiency and, most critically, provides real-time location data during emergencies. The system will be implemented in phases, starting with a pilot program, and will adhere strictly to Malaysia's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2010.

**2. Core Challenges with the Current System**

- **Inefficient:** Manual attendance taking is time-consuming for both academic and administrative staff.
- **Inaccurate:** Prone to human error, buddy punching, and difficult to collate for reporting.
- **Lack of Real-Time Data:** In an emergency (e.g., fire, lockdown), we have no reliable way to quickly ascertain who is in a specific building or zone, significantly hampering evacuation and muster reporting.


**3. Proposed Technology Solution (A Hybrid Approach)**

A single technology is insufficient for a diverse campus environment. I recommend a two-layered hybrid system:

- **Layer 1: NFC/RFID for Access Control (The Primary Method)**

    - **How it Works:** All existing staff and student ID cards will be enabled with NFC/RFID technology. Readers will be installed at all main building entrances, key laboratories, and secure zones. Personnel tap their card to enter.

    - **Pros:** Highly secure, proven technology, low cost per card, integrates well with door lock systems.

    - **Cons:** Requires an active tap; doesn't cover presence within a large open area like a lecture hall.

- **Layer 2: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons for Zone Presence (The Secondary Method)**

    - **How it Works:** Small, low-power BLE beacons are placed in key areas like lecture halls, libraries, and assembly points. A university safety app on staff/student smartphones detects these beacons passively and securely checks them into the zone. The ID card can also be equipped with a BLE tag as a phone-free alternative.

    - **Pros:** Automated check-in (no tapping required), excellent for emergency mustering, low power consumption.

    - **Cons:** Relies on users having a smartphone with Bluetooth enabled or a BLE-enabled card.


**4. Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Planning & Pilot Program (3 Months)**

- **Form a Steering Committee:** Include representatives from Security, IT, HR, Student Affairs, and a Faculty.

- **Conduct Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):** Formally document data handling procedures to ensure PDPA compliance. Be transparent: the system tracks presence at _checkpoints and zones_, not continuous real-time movement across campus.

- **Select a Pilot Location:** Choose one faculty building to be the testbed.

- **Vendor Selection:** Issue a tender for qualified hardware and software vendors.


**Phase 2: Pilot Implementation & Testing (3 Months)**

- **Infrastructure Installation:** Install NFC readers and BLE beacons in the pilot building.

- **Software Integration:** Work with IT to integrate the attendance platform with the university's HR and Student Information Systems.

- **Communication Campaign:** Inform pilot users (staff and students) about the system, its benefits, and the privacy safeguards.

- **Testing & Feedback:** Run the system, gather feedback, and fix bugs.


**Phase 3: Phased Campus-Wide Rollout (12-18 Months)**

- Based on the success of the pilot, create a schedule to roll out the system to the rest of the campus building by building.


**Phase 4: Full Operation & Maintenance**

- **Security Command Center Dashboard:** Provide the security team with a live dashboard for monitoring access and emergency mustering.

- **Automated Reporting:** Configure the system to automatically generate attendance reports for HR and academic departments.

- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Schedule for battery replacement in beacons and hardware checks.

    - **Multi-Sided Markets:** Some platforms serve multiple segments that rely on each other. For example, the triathlon app serves athletes, coaches, and retailers. The logistics platform serves cargo owners, logistics providers, insurers, and government authorities.

    - **Internal Stakeholders:** For internal projects like the university attendance system, the "customers" are the various internal departments that benefit, such as University Administration, Security, and HR.

### 2. Customer Relationships

- **What it Means:** This describes the type of interaction a company establishes with its specific customer segments, ranging from highly automated to deeply personal.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Automated & Self-Service:** This is the most common relationship type for consumer-facing apps. Users interact primarily through the app or a website with minimal human assistance, as seen in the transportation, shopping, and triathlon scenarios.

    - **Long-Term Enterprise Partnerships:** For high-value B2B or B2G (business-to-government) clients, the relationship is a deep partnership involving dedicated account managers, co-development of features, and long-term contracts. This is crucial for the Carbon Auditing, Logistics, and Urban Analytics platforms.

    - **Community & Ecosystem Management:** In models where the value comes from connecting different users, a key relationship involves managing that community, such as with the triathlon app's sharing features and the logistics platform's governing council.


### 3. Channels

- **What it Means:** This block describes how a company communicates with and reaches its Customer Segments to deliver its Value Proposition.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Mobile Applications & Websites:** These are the primary channels for delivering the service and interacting with users in nearly all the consumer-focused scenarios.

    - **Direct Enterprise Sales Teams:** For complex, high-cost solutions targeting corporations or governments, the main channel is a direct sales team that engages with leadership, responds to tenders, and negotiates contracts.

    - **Strategic Partnerships:** Leveraging partners as a channel is common. This includes co-selling with ESG consulting firms or using humanitarian logistics providers to distribute disaster response pods.

    - **Physical Delivery:** For models involving physical products, direct shipping and logistics networks are a critical channel to get goods to the end-user.


### 4. Key Partners

- **What it Means:** This describes the network of suppliers, collaborators, and other partners that make the business model work.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Technology Providers:** Every scenario, without exception, relies on technology partners, including cloud platform providers (like AWS, Azure), hardware manufacturers (sensors, smart devices), and specialized software developers (blockchain, GPS).

    - **Domain-Specific Ecosystem:** Businesses partner with key players in their specific industry. The shopping service partners with appliance manufacturers and consumer goods suppliers; the transportation app partners with transit operators; the carbon platform partners with ESG auditors.

    - **Government & Aid Agencies:** In scenarios involving public services or regulated industries, government bodies, customs authorities, and international aid agencies are essential partners for legal frameworks, distribution, and validation.


### 5. Key Activities

- **What it Means:** This describes the most important actions a company must perform to operate successfully and deliver its value proposition.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Platform Development and R&D:** For all tech-based solutions, the most fundamental activity is the ongoing research, development, and maintenance of the software and hardware platform.

    - **Data Processing and Management:** A recurring key activity is the aggregation, processing, and analysis of data to provide insights, predictions, or automated actions.

    - **Partnership & Ecosystem Management:** Actively building and managing relationships with key partners is a critical activity mentioned in almost every scenario.

    - **Logistics and Deployment:** For scenarios involving physical products or services, activities like supply chain management, inventory management, and field deployment are essential.


### 6. Key Resources

- **What it Means:** This describes the most important assets required to make a business model work. These can be physical, intellectual, human, or financial.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Proprietary Platform & Software:** The technology platform itself is consistently listed as the most important resource. This includes the software, AI models, and protocols developed by the business.

    - **A Skilled Team:** Human resources, specifically expert teams with skills in areas like data science, IoT, blockchain, ESG regulations, or public health, are a critical asset.

    - **Data & Agreements:** User-generated data and the formal partnership agreements that enable data sharing are listed as key resources.

    - **The Network Effect:** In platform models like the logistics network, the network of participating partners is itself a key resource that becomes more valuable as it grows.


### 7. Cost Structure

- **What it Means:** This describes all the costs incurred to operate a business model.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Personnel Costs:** Salaries for skilled teams, especially for R&D, sales, and support, are a primary cost driver across all scenarios.

    - **R&D and Platform Maintenance:** Ongoing investment in developing the technology and the costs associated with cloud infrastructure (data storage, processing) are universally significant costs.

    - **Sales & Marketing Expenses:** For B2B and B2G models, the costs associated with long sales cycles and marketing are specifically noted.

    - **Physical Goods & Deployment Costs:** For models that involve hardware, costs include Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and deployment expenses.


### 8. Revenue Stream

- **What it Means:** This describes how a company generates cash from its customer segments.

- **Common Patterns Across Scenarios:**

    - **Subscription Fees:** The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, with recurring annual or monthly fees, is the preferred model for enterprise solutions like the carbon auditing and urban analytics platforms.

    - **Transaction & Referral Fees:** Marketplace platforms often generate revenue by taking a commission or fee on transactions they facilitate, as seen in the triathlon and transportation apps.

    - **Sale of Goods:** A straightforward stream where revenue comes from selling physical products, like in the automated shopping and decentralized health scenarios.

    - **Implementation & Service Fees:** Many B2B models charge a one-time fee for setup and integration, in addition to ongoing subscriptions.

    - **Unique Models:** Specialized scenarios require unique revenue models, such as the annual retainer and leasing fees for the disaster response pods or grant funding for the non-profit health solution.

    - **Value Generation (Internal Projects):** For the internal university project, there is no direct revenue; instead, the focus is on "Value Generation" through cost savings and risk mitigation.
