## Question 2

### 2.a)

- **Digital Pins**:
	- These pins can read or write only two states:  HIGH or LOW.
	- They are used for simple inputs like a button press or outputs like turning an LED on or off.
- **Analog Pins**
	- These pins are used for reading a range of voltage levels.
	- The Arduino converts this voltage into an integer value from 0 to 1023.
	- They are used to read sensors with variable outputs, such as potentiometer or a light sensor.
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Pins**:
	- These are specialized digital pins that can simulate an analog output.
	- They control the analog output by switching rapidly between HIGH and LOW at a fixed frequency.
	- The output ranges from 0 to 255.

- Raspberry Pi: Has built-in Wi-Fi capability and is used to establish Wi-Fi connection and setup remote IoT server remotely.
- Arduino Uno: Has analog pin and can read analog values directly from sensors (i.e., temperature sensor(s) and soil moisture sensor(s)). It is also used to turn on or off the actuators (i.e. water sprinkler(s)) based on the predefine thresholds or upon farmer's actions.
- No, we cannot remove the Raspberry Pi because Arduino Uno lacks native networking capabilities (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). The Raspberry Pi is essential to bridge the local system to the internet, enabling the remote access requested by the farmer.

>[!info] Additional notes
>- Raspberry Pi serves as the IoT gateway. It has built-in Wi-Fi to connect to the internet via the Wi-Fi router. It can

>- Arduino Uno acts as the real-time controller for the sensors and actuators. Due to the analog pins, it can read analog data directly from the soil moisture and temperature sensors.

### 5.b)

Servo motor and a ball valve

**Integration**
- Install the ball valve in the water pipe leading to the sprinklers.
- The servo motor is mounted onto the valve, with its alarm physically attached to the valve's handle.
- The servo motor is connected directly to a PWM pin or the Arduino Uno.

**Control Flow**
- The farmer remotely sends a command that specifies the desired water flow.
- The command goes through the internet, the Wi-Fi router, and the Raspberry Pi, which then relays the instruction to the Arduino.
- The Arduino would then send a specific PWM signal to the servo, causing it to rotate to a precise angle (e.g., 90 degrees for 50% flow), which in turn adjusts the ball valve to control the water flow.
